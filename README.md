**Executive summary:**

Chicago and its communities is facing unprecedented challenges due to the economic fallout from COVID-19. Social distancing has necessitated a dramatically reduced taxi ridership compared to previous years. This has left the taxi companies, drivers, and their families far below their expected revenue, a trend which is going to continue in coming months.

We have conducted a research, analyzing taxi rides data, which allowed us to understand the big picture of the crisis and a dramatic decrease of revenues in the industry, and developed recommendations to interested parties.

We expect that this analysis allow the different stakeholders to develop mitigation mechanisms and allocate financial resources, while considering both policy objectives and the shareholder expectations.

For our research we used data from Chicago Open Data Portal and conducted the exploratory data analysis together with building predictive models for further recommendations.
